# riak_zmq

This is a small OTP application, based on
[this gist](https://gist.github.com/1165753) that provides a
[Riak KV](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv) postcommit hook for
publishing updates to [0MQ](http://zeromq.org).

## Status

This is meant to be a proof-of-concept only. It is neither tested nor
otherwise guaranteed to work.  Thanks to
[@codysoyland](https://gist.github.com/codysoyland) for the initial
code.
